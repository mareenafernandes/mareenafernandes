Hey thereüëã,

I am an Incoming Business Analyst fresher, skilled in analyzing and interpreting consumer behavior and trends through data patterns. I am also an IT Engineering graduate with interest and experience in project management, project financing, and human resources management. I have experience handling online marketing and publicity campaigns for small and medium-scale enterprises. Enthusiastic graphic designer and amateur artist. I have done really simple and easy to understand projects (please refer to my repositories for the topics and codes). I also love listening to music in my free time other than being creative.

### Maxzeal

Being an artist and making paintings was not considered cool in my society also because I was pursuing Technology. Maxzeal was initiated when I focused on creating Digital Artwork and Illustrations. I never gave up on the traditional paintings and still make them, but obviously give them the Digital touch by creating mockups. I think there is a long way for my Graphic Designing interest and I want to pursue a career in Visual Design. I ‚ù§Ô∏è how creative a frame can get and portray so much.

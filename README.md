Hey thereüëã,

I am currently pursuing IT Engineering from Mumbai University. I am a self-taught graphic designing enthusiast and I have recently started social media handles for the purpose of showcasing my artwork. The link to my art account is mentioned above. Other than my ongoing degree in IT Engineering I also enjoy Managemental challenges. I have done really simple and easy to understand projects (please refer to my repositories for the topics and codes). I also love listening to music in my free time other than being creative.

### Maxzeal

Being an artist and making paintings was not considered cool in my society also because I was pursuing Technology. Maxzeal was initiated when I focused on creating Digital Artwork and Illustrations. I never gave up on the traditional paintings and still make them, but obviously give them the Digital touch by creating mockups. I think there is a long way for my Graphic Designing interest and I want to pursue a career in Visual Design. I ‚ù§Ô∏è how creative a frame can get and portray so much.
